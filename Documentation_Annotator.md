### Annotator Documentation - [http://psa-annotator.ddns.net](http://psa-annotator.ddns.net)

#### Important Notes:
* **Label Studio Free Edition does not provide multiple annotations per task (by one or more Collaborators). The workaround of this limitation is to annotate each image (task) by creating a new labeling instance ('+' button) according to the guidline below.**

* **Label Studio Free Edition does not provide Roles (eg. owners, admins, annotators, reviewers). Please limit yourselves in labeling the images (tasks).**

**1. Login:**

#### Tasks Guideline:

**1. Color (required - 1):**

The **dominant** (strongest) color in the image.

**3. Depth of Field (DoF) (required - 1):**

Choose **Deep** if the image appears sharp or **Shallow** if the image appears more blurry.

A composition can me made up of many different elements, or only a few.
