## Annotator Documentation - [http://psa-annotator.ddns.net](http://psa-annotator.ddns.net)

### Important Notes:
* **Label Studio Free Edition does not provide multiple annotations per task (by one or more Collaborators). The workaround of this limitation is to annotate each image (task) by creating a new labeling instance ('+' button) according to the guidline below.**

* **Label Studio Free Edition does not provide Roles (eg. owners, admins, annotators, reviewers). Please limit yourselves in labeling the images (tasks).**

**1. Login:**

### Tasks Guideline:

**1. Color (required - 1):**
Image is **Colorful** or **Monochromatic (B&W)**, including **toning**.
In photography, **toning** is a method of changing the color of B&W photographs.
For example, Sepia is considered a form of B&W Photography with different tone.

**2. Color Palette (required - 1+):**
The **dominant-s** (strongest-s) color-s in the image.

**3. Depth of Field (DoF) (required - 1):**
The distance between the nearest and the farthest objects that are in acceptably sharp focus in an image.
Choose **Deep** if the image appears sharp or **Shallow** if the image appears more blurry.

**4. Composition/Technique: (required - 1+)**
How the elements of a photo are arranged.
A composition can me made up of many different elements, or only a few.

**5. Type: (required - 1+)**
In short, what is captured in the photo (what its main subject is).
